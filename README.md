# Tanks-Physics-Game

A 2 player tank game with realistic projectile physics that encourages players to use projectile motion calculations to aim their shots.

Long reload times, lack of aim indicators, and exact coordinate displays all serve to nudge players into using projectile motion calculations. Optimally, you can derive a single equation that takes delta x, delta y, and velocity as input and outputs the necessary angle to create that trajectory.

Can be played through the exe, jar, or the java project.
